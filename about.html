    <h1>About</h1>
    <p><i>This is Kyla’s class website for <a href="http://spring2018-yale.veryinteractive.net" target="_blank">Spring 2018’s Art369b: Interactive Design and the Internet</a></i>.</p>

    <p>Kyla Arsadjaja (°1994, Jakarta, Indonesia) is an artist who works in a variety of media. By focusing on techniques and materials, Arsadjaja makes work that deals with the documentation of events and the question of how they can be presented. The work tries to express this with the help of physics and technology, but not by telling a story or creating a metaphor.</p>
    <p>Her artworks are notable for their perfect finish and tactile nature. This is of great importance and bears witness to great craftsmanship. With Plato’s allegory of the cave in mind, she tries to develop forms that do not follow logical criteria, but are based only on subjective associations and formal parallels, which incite the viewer to make new personal associations.</p>
    <p>Her works directly respond to the surrounding environment and uses everyday experiences from the artist as a starting point. Often these are framed instances that would go unnoticed in their original context. By choosing mainly formal solutions, she tries to approach a wide scale of subjects in a multi-layered way, likes to involve the viewer in a way that is sometimes physical and believes in the idea of function following form in a work.</p>
    <p>Her works are an investigation into representations of (seemingly) concrete ages and situations as well as depictions and ideas that can only be realized in art. With a conceptual approach, she considers making art a craft which is executed using clear formal rules and which should always refer to social reality.</p>
    <p>Her works are based on formal associations which open a unique poetic vein. Multilayered images arise in which the fragility and instability of our seemingly certain reality is questioned. Kyla Arsadjaja currently lives and works in New Haven, CT.</p>
